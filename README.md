How did this one go?

I tried to get creative with the Blobmaker, and mobile-friendly styling at 600px and lower.

Spent a lot of time messing with centering the boxes and landed on using positioning. Probably spent too long on the details but I'm satisfied. Really like the 'Outfit' font that was recommended by FEM.
